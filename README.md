# panda-css + htmx + bun

This repo is a demo of using [panda-css](https://panda-css.com/) with [htmx](https://htmx.org/) and [bun](https://bun.sh/).

The idea is heavily inspired by ["The BETH stack"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpzowDDJj24) video by Ethan Niser.

If you prefer `panda-css` for the developer experience it provides and you want to have less client-side JavaScript, this repo is for you.  

#### Install

```bash
bun install
```

#### Run

```bash
bun run dev
```
